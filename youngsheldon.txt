Young Sheldon is an American coming-of-age sitcom television series created by Chuck Lorre and Steven Molaro for CBS. The series, set in the 1980s and early 1990s, is a spin-off prequel to The Big Bang Theory and follows main character Sheldon Cooper growing up with his family in East Texas. Iain Armitage stars as young Sheldon, alongside Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, and Annie Potts. Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, narrates the series and is also an executive producer.
Development of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to The Big Bang Theory producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. Young Sheldon premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and was picked up for a full season that began airing weekly from November 2, 2017. In March 2021, CBS renewed the series through to a seventh season.
Premise[edit]
The series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s and follows Sheldon Cooper's early life as a child prodigy in the fictional town of Medford, Texas. As he grows up, he tries to fit into a world of people, including his own family and friends, who do not quite understand his unique intellectual capabilities and social ineptitude.[1][2]
In the series premiere, adult Sheldon states "nobody I knew in East Texas in 1989 cared about Newtonian physics".[3][a] Several other episodes make spoken or written references to, or reference historic or pop cultural events from the early 1990s.[4][5][b]

Main[edit]
	•	Iain Armitage as Sheldon Lee Cooper, a child prodigy well-versed in various branches of mathematics and science. He states that he decided to pursue physics around the same time as the show began. While academically gifted, Sheldon sometimes lacks a full understanding of social cues, in addition to having a sense of superiority over everyone around him. His superior intellect has made him extremely arrogant, self-righteous, selfish, disrespectful, rude, obnoxious and condescending. Nevertheless, Sheldon has proven to love his family and almost always has his heart in the right place. He is Georgie's younger brother and Missy’s fraternal older twin brother. He begins attending high school at age 9 and college full time at age 11.
	◦	Jim Parsons is the voice of adult Sheldon Cooper, who provides the perspective of an adult recalling his childhood.[1]
	•	Zoe Perry as Mary Cooper (née Tucker), mother of Sheldon, Missy, and Georgie. She is very overprotective and overly patient with Sheldon, but also struggles to understand him at times. Nevertheless she has given him a long leash and almost always forgives him for anything and everything even if it is unforgivable and hence has spoiled Sheldon very much. She is a devout Southern Baptist, working at her local church, and sometimes objects to Sheldon's atheism. Nevertheless, she deeply loves her son and wants to protect him for as long as she can.[6] Perry's mother, Laurie Metcalf, played Mary on The Big Bang Theory.
	•	Lance Barber as George Cooper Sr., Sheldon, Missy, and Georgie's father; a Vietnam veteran; and the head football coach at Medford High. George does not share Sheldon's intellect, which sometimes leads others, especially Meemaw, to doubt his genetic relationship to Sheldon. He is often at odds with his children and particularly struggles to understand Sheldon, but he does try to be a caring and responsible father. In The Big Bang Theory, it is stated that George Cooper Sr. will die when Sheldon is 14 years old in 1994. Barber appeared in a Season 5 episode of The Big Bang Theory as one of Leonard's high school bullies, Jimmy Speckerman, before making an appearance via a 1990s videotape as his Young Sheldon character in a final season episode.
	•	Montana Jordan as George Marshall "Georgie" Cooper Jr., Sheldon and Missy's older brother. Georgie resents the attention his parents pay to Sheldon. He does not do well at school and gets mocked and teased for it by the rest of the family, particularly Sheldon and Meemaw. He does not get along with his brother Sheldon because he's tired of always being compared to his brother. He attends Medford High with Sheldon and plays on the school's football team.[1][2] At age 17, he drops out of school to work full-time and discovers a talent for sales that will lead him to become the wealthy owner of a tire store chain in The Big Bang Theory, on which he is played by Jerry O'Connell.
	•	Raegan Revord as Melissa "Missy" Cooper, Georgie's younger sister and Sheldon's younger twin sister. She teases Sheldon along with Georgie but not as much. She does not share Sheldon's intelligence, but is very perceptive. Occasionally, she does not get along with Sheldon, but she finds in her twin brother a solid confidant and has admitted to not feeling as whole without him. She also shows love for her brother even though she constantly denies it.[1] Courtney Henggeler plays adult Missy in The Big Bang Theory.
	•	Annie Potts as Constance "Connie" Tucker, Sheldon, Missy, and Georgie's maternal grandmother, whom they refer to as "Meemaw". She is a fun-loving woman who can be sarcastic and often mocks those around her, especially George. On the other hand, she is patient with Sheldon and sometimes struggles to understand him, whom she affectionately calls 'Moonpie', and advises Mary to trust that Sheldon will find his way.[7] In the fourth season, she is said to be 68 years old. June Squibb plays old Constance in The Big Bang Theory.
	•	Matt Hobby as Pastor Jeff Difford (season 3–present; recurring seasons 1–2), the upbeat pastor at the Cooper family's Baptist church. Like Mary, he too sometimes has friction with Sheldon's irreligious side and often challenges Sheldon to explore their line of thought through logic exercises.
	•	Wyatt McClure as William "Billy" Sparks (season 5–present; recurring seasons 1–4), the son of Herschel and Brenda, whom his mother implies is in no danger of going to college. He was originally portrayed as Sheldon's nemesis, but becomes much friendlier early in the series. He has an unrequited crush on Missy.
	•	Emily Osment as Mandy McAllister (season 6;[8] recurring season 5), Georgie's 29-year-old girlfriend, with whom he has a child.
